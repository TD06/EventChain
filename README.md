Mission
To revolutionize the event ticketing industry by leveraging blockchain technology, eliminating ticket fraud, preventing scalping, and ensuring fair access to tickets while providing organizers with better control over resale and revenue distribution.

Vision
To create a secure, transparent, and decentralized ticketing ecosystem where every ticket is unique, verifiable, and accessible, ensuring a seamless and fair experience for both event organizers and attendees worldwide.

SWOT Analysis
Strengths 
1. Blockchain Security – NFT-based tickets eliminate counterfeiting and duplication.
2. Transparency – Every ticket sale and transfer is publicly recorded on-chain.
3. Resale Royalties – Event organizers earn a percentage from secondary sales, reducing scalping profits.
4. Fast & Efficient – Automated smart contracts streamline ticket issuance and validation.

Weaknesses
1. Adoption Barrier – Users unfamiliar with blockchain might find it challenging to use wallets and NFTs.
2. Gas Fees – Transactions on blockchain networks may incur additional costs.
3. Regulatory Uncertainty – Different countries have varying laws regarding NFTs and crypto transactions.

Opportunities
1. Growing NFT Market – Expanding use of NFTs in real-world applications, including ticketing.
2. Partnerships with Events & Artists – Collaborating with music festivals, concerts, and sports leagues to integrate NFT ticketing.
3. Integration with Loyalty Programs – Similar to Dreamus (South Korea), ticketing could be linked with reward platforms.
4. Expansion to Virtual & Hybrid Events – Secure access to online events through NFT verification.

Threats
1. Competition from Traditional Systems – Established ticketing giants (e.g., Ticketmaster, Eventbrite) may resist blockchain adoption.
2. Scalability Issues – High-demand events may cause network congestion on blockchain platforms.
3. Cybersecurity Risks – Users could fall victim to phishing scams or wallet hacks if not educated on security best practices.
